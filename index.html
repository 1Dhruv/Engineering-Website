            SOOOOOOO this week I was abscent for 2 days of class.  So on Monday we learned
            about mechanical engineering and safety with dangerous machine.  Then the
            next day we learned about tinker cad and how to use it.  Then as I said next 2 
            days abscent.  I was absent since I felt weak from fasting and the next day 
            I was at the temple.  So that brings us to toady with me updating my website.
            Below is a picture of the temple  I went to.

            This week we made proper cads.  We had to cad a rube golberg machine.
            It is basiclly a simple machine that starts by pusing a ball to poping
            a ballon.  Mr.Poole left us today and will leave us tomorrow to.  It
            is sad :(.

            This week we started making our Rube Goldberg mchine.  It is a thing with 3 simple
            machines.  We use a see saw, slope, and lever.  Something else we did 
            was the boat challenge.  We have to make a paper boat that can hold the
            most weight for the longest time.  I hope we won.  Somehting interesting
            is that we basiclly jerry riged the whole thing.

            This week we worked on our rube guldberg machine.  We were succesful.  We 
            popped our first balloon but not the second because the balloon started to deflate.
            I wanted to beat up Christian for harassing me in typing.
