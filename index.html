            This week we sarted school and are doing fun things.  Yesterday we did a
            challenge to get the marbles in the bucket.

            SOOOOOOO this week I was abscent for 2 days of class.  So on Monday we learned
            about mechanical engineering and safety with dangerous machine.  Then the
            next day we learned about tinker cad and how to use it.  Then as I said next 2 
            days abscent.  I was absent since I felt weak from fasting and the next day 
            I was at the temple.  So that brings us to toady with me updating my website.
            Below is a picture of the temple  I went to.

            This week we made proper cads.  We had to cad a rube golberg machine.
            It is basiclly a simple machine that starts by pusing a ball to poping
            a ballon.  Mr.Poole left us today and will leave us tomorrow to.  It
            is sad :(.

            This week we started making our Rube Goldberg mchine.  It is a thing with 3 simple
            machines.  We use a see saw, slope, and lever.  Something else we did 
            was the boat challenge.  We have to make a paper boat that can hold the
            most weight for the longest time.  I hope we won.  Somehting interesting
            is that we basiclly jerry riged the whole thing.

            This week we worked on our rube guldberg machine.  We were succesful.  We 
            popped our first balloon but not the second because the balloon started to deflate.
            I wanted to beat up Christian for harassing me in typing.

            This week we made animal prostetics and uploaded previos projects.  
            We took a couple days on CADing our prostetic so that is basiclly what we did this week.

            This week we disected the computer and saw the internals.  Once we took
            everything out we had to identify what each part was and then colored it on
            a sheet.  Once we identified it we then had to put everything back into
            the computer.  Interesting fact is that today friday the 7th we are in someone's
            classroom because the wifi and power is out in Mr.Pooles classroom.:)

            This week has been fun and relaxing.  2 minimum days in one week how cool is
            that.  Who can say that.  Something funny happened this week.  We are in a new 
            classroom this week since a fuse had sparks in mr.Poole's classroom so we have 
            been relocated.  Because of this we didn't really finish putting our computer back
            together.  But this week learned about aerospace engineering and the 4 factors
            that help a plane fly:Drag, lift, gravity, and trust.  We demonstarted this
            in a compotetion using paper airplanes.  After that mr.Poole thought us how
            to make a BOM.  We are going to use that BOM to make our rocket out of a 2 litter
            bottle.  So this is what we have been up to this week.:)
        </p>

            10/22/22
            So this week we started to assemble our bottle.  We used a 2L coke bottle.
            We did this project in groups of 3 so in my group it was me, MingYu, and Austin.
            We started of with a paper drawing.  After that we made a cad then we made it in
            real life.  Something fun we figured our is that you can hot glue paper together.
            So we built the rocket out of paper, cardboard, some kind of knock of wood, 2L
            bottle, and hot glue of course.  So the teamwork was just amazing I say sarcasticly.
            The kind of rocket we where going for was like a glider.  When it came to the actual
            launch our rocket's glider fell of and the bottle went flying.  Yha then that was my
            week so goodbye now.

            So this week we didn't do much.  But we did do one thing interesting.
            We made a using rocks, pebbles, sand, and a cotton ball to clean the water.
            We where basiclly making a life straw but not as good as it.  I gotta say
            we did decent in making the water clean.  Somehting to note is that when we ran the water
            through the filter again it helped and cleaned the water better.

            11/4/22
            So this week we are learning about electical Engineering.  We have made a
            3D breadboard and are learning about diodes, recistors, volts, ohms and more.  
            We learn't about ohms's law and the equations to find volts, amps, and ohms.
            We also learned about diffrent types of a circuit and Jason found out that in tinker CAD you 
            can make it so that a potato outputs about 150 volts. 
            So today is fun because it is friday and I don't have to be at school.  I am at
            the long beach convention center for robotics as we where invited to represent FIRST
            at XPrize.  Woke up at 5:30 was just so fun.  So yha this was my week now addios :] :).

            So this week we used cicuitboards to make circuits.  We used a couple diffrent 
            components.  We used recistors, rdweno, diodes, and wires.  We learned a couple
            diffrent types of circucits and one of them was a paralell circuit.  
            A paralell circuit is when each diode gets it's own power supply so the 
            voltage is the same for each diode and it emits the same amount of light.  This week
             we also had a debate on wheter it would be better to write the numbers from 1-1000000 
            or take a math class.

            So it is that time of the week.  This week we countined doing electrical engineering 
            and doing circuit.  Not only that but we also went back to enviormental 
            engineering by making a solution for bromide water.  My group made a solution
            of makeing a tarp to cover the water from the sun then adding heat lamps to keep the
            make the water boil so the chlorine can evaporate.  The solution that was acctually 
            used for that lake was using holo balls to cover everything from the sun so the chemical
            reactino can't happen.  Like I said we also worked on circuits but this time we used
            the arduino to code so we could turn some diodes on and some off.  Today is the last week before 
            thanksgiving break starts.  Over thangskiving break I don't do any celabration but I do use that time to travell to 
            cool places :) . I am so excited because I am traveling and I am going
            to Jamaca.  Over their I will do fun stuff like zipline chill at the hotel and also my favorite
            thing now scubadiving.  Going to possibly be fully licensed or almost licensed to scuba dive anywhere in the world
            with or without an instructor.  So yha this what I am doing so goodbye and see you people next time.

            This is a picture of my solution to a real world problem.  It is a tarp
            that has heat lamps and ventilation to get rid of the steam.  Not really
            the best solution :(:(
